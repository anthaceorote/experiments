# Learning Dash

[**Dash**](https://plot.ly/dash/) is Python framework for building web applications.  
It is the *'Shiny'* for Python.

To try it out, I followed the tutorials on the Dash website:  
* Tut 0: [Installation](https://plot.ly/dash/installation)
* Tut 1: [App Layout](https://plot.ly/dash/getting-started)
	- [Generating basic HTML](/app01.py)
	- [Reusable Components (Tables)](/app02.py)
	- [Simple Visualization using Graph Component](/app03.py)
	- [Markdown in Dash](/app04.py)
	- [Introduction to Core Components - Lists, Checkboxes, Radio, Dropdown, Input](/app05.py)
* Tut 2: [Interactivity](https://plot.ly/dash/getting-started-part-2)
	- [Introducing Interactivity](/app06.py)
	- [Interactivity 2 - Updating a graph using a slider](/app07.py)
	- [Binding multiple inputs to a single output](/app08.py)
	- [Multiple Interactive Outputs](/app09.py)
	- [Chaining Outputs - Output of one function as input to other](/app10.py)
	- [Changing components of dcc.Graph through interaction - hoverData, clickData, selectedData](/app11.py)
	- [Updating Graph based on interaction with other graph](/app12.py)


The apps generated are interactive, and fast.  
While following the tutorials, although I was overwhelmed by code, I guess one could get used to this style as this is just in Python, without using any external tags. The nesting might feel like a drag.  

My suggestion:  
Follow these tutorials ([Core Components](https://plot.ly/dash/dash-core-components), [HTML Components](https://plot.ly/dash/dash-html-components)) first, before starting with extensive ones mentioned above and get a feel for the style.  

My opinion:  
I might have to do another project specifically putting time for Dash; for now, I'm sticking with Shiny.
