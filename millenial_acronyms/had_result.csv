"aks","Aks","aks is a common way to pronounce ""ask.""

etymologically, the word ask is derived from the old english word for ""ask"". the old english term had two forms, acsian and ascian, the former being the literary standard until about 1600 when the latter gained the imprimatur of being the high style variant. the /aks/ variant was and still is utilized in several dialects of united kingdom and is particularly associated with the west country dialect of england.

in the united states, the /aks/ variant is a particular feature of african american vernacular english (aave). it is possible that /aks/ variant was also the form most commonly used in the dialect of english to which the slaves were originally exposed, and has persisted in aave for the same sociolinguistic reasons that other features persist. the /aks/ variable in aave is unique in that it is the only example of such a phonetic shift, and thus is unique to the word ""ask.""

the /aks/ variant is an example of the natural switching of sounds called metathesis. this occurs usually because in the speech sound patterns of that language or dialect that pronunciation may be easier. this is not a degenerate way of speaking. all languages and dialects are linguistically equal as they are all systematic and rule governed.

"axe","Axe","common stereotype of black vernacular is the pronunciation of the word ""ask"" as ""axe.""

""axe"" traces back to the 8th century. the pronunciation derives from the old english verb ""acsian."" at the time, the word appeared in two forms, ""ascian"" and ""acsian."" by the 10th century, the latter became ""axsian,"" which was shortened to ""ax"" (or ""axe""). it wasn't until the 17th century that ""ask"" became commonplace, eventually replacing ""axe"" in literary works. nonetheless, the pronunciation ""axe"" remained in dialects across the caribbean and the american south (including some sections of england). such usage was not dependent on race or class. although its written form fell out of usage in the 17th century, the dialectic use of ""axe"" has survived into the 21st century.

unfortunately, usage of ""axe"" has become a lightning rod for racist diatribes against african americans, often attributing its dialectic usage as a sign of being uncultivated and uncultured. references to ""axe"" being ""ghetto"" is nothing more than etymological ignorance, respectability politics and outright racism."
"axl","Axl","like him or not, axl rose is one interesting person and most often he is misunderstood. some people like to think of axl as an asshole, but that is just because axl likes to keep to himself and he likes his privacy. axl does not crave attention or look to make headlines, he does that with out even trying and sometimes i think that embarrasses him. i know a lot of gn’r fans get p!ssed off at axl because he has not been telling us his every move or what his plans are but i think that is a good thing. axl seems to get himself in trouble every time he tells us about a possible tour, a possible release date or anything else for that matter. when axl has told us about tentative tours or release dates and then those things fall through or dates pass by people bash him because they didn’t happen, that is why i think axl doesn’t want to say anything until he is 100% positive it is going to happen. that is why i don’t think will hear from axl until he knows the album is 100% done and the release date is set in stone. i don’t think axl likes to disappoint his fans and this is his best way of getting our hopes up for the release of this album. another thing fans need to keep in mind is that axl wants to make the best possible he can, and he does not care how long it takes, this album will be his legacy. this album will make or break his career since it is his first album with out the old band.   a lot of old gn’r fans like to think the new songs we have heard so far are not as good as the old bands songs, but that is not the important question. the important question is, are the new songs as good or better than the current mainstream songs on the radio today? and imo the answer to that is yes. i think madagascar, the blues and chinese democracy are just as good if not better than a lot of the music on the radio right now, and those songs are not even the “big guns” that axl has in store for us.   if axl does things correctly i think 2005 could be his year. he has a set of amazing players backing him up and they have all worked very hard on this album. the few people that have heard the album have all said how great or amazing the songs are, so i think if cd is promoted the way it should be it could be the best album of 2005. axl and his new gn’r could also be on top of the music world again. just look at a few years ago the mtv mva’s. they got a huge pop and people were going ape sh!t. the u.s. tour was not as bad as some naysayers would have you believe. the u.s. tour did pretty damn well considering there was almost no promotion for it and no new album in sight. just think of how the tour would do with the band having a hit single on the radio, the album being released, a possible video on mtv and proper promotion for the tour. i think it could be huge. all axl has to do is release the album and let it speak for itself. axl has to understand he can’t please everyone. yes axl will lose some of the old fans with the new band and new sound, but he will also pick up many more fans along the way. as bad as axl sounded back then he sounded better than the crappy live bands tonight on the vmas.  it is now time for axl to take his throne back as the best front man in rock, others have tried but none have even come close to having axl presence or aura. axl holds his own destiny and legacy in his own hands. he can either be the huge star he used to be or he can just disappear again. either way axl rose will always be one of music great mysteries. place."

"cch","Cchs","cchs, or cramlington community high school, is a school found in the north-east of england. strangely enough, it is in a town called cramlington. it is a multi-cultural school, accepting a diverse mix of [chav]’s, [emo]’s, [scene kids] and barbie’s. there is much tension among these groups, with at least one argument per lesson between them. there are two sides- the chav’s and the barbie’s, and the emo’s and the scene kids. conflict is inevitable.  teachers at cchs are unable to control there classes, unless they are a head of population, all of which are quite intimidating. some teachers are able to control small classes, however when the number of students breaches 20, control is lost. this is mainly because of the chav’s short attention span, and are often compared to chimps by english teachers. when a chav at cchs loses interest, common side effects include: -shouting across the room “how man! (some unintelligent nickname here) yu comin’ oot the night?” -the throwing of paper and writing implements across the classroom.  -hurling several unintelligible insults at the teacher and emo’s/ scene kids.  -humming the theme tune to some stephen spielberg film, typically jaws. -shouting “sir/miss! a divvent ger it!” when they haven’t attempted to do any work set.  -spreading rumours that clearly are not true, just for fun and attention. half the time they don’t know who they’re talking about.  a typical cchs male chav has thick hair on the top, but shaved at the sides, giving off the impression of someone who just lost control of the razor rather than looking “fit” and “mint as”. they walk poker- straight with their hands tucked into their pockets. if the male chav is surrounded by female chav’s and possibly one other chubby male chav, he gets classified as “camp”. the most commonly noticed male camp chav has earned the nickname of “gaymien” by all non-chav’s/barbie’s. no insult intended to any gay’s- the gaymien is an insult to everyone.  males surrounded by more male chav’s are just classified as “chav’s”. chav’s in year nine and below are called “hardcore radgies”.  female chav’s look a lot like the males. they have greasy hair that gets tied in a low ponytail without the assistance of a h**r br*sh (apologies- female chav’s are allergic to this phrase). most come to school wearing tracksuit pants and their jumper that hasn’t been washed since they got it. most look like they have been hit by a bus three times and have never recovered. unfortunately, it isn’t that simple.  barbie’s, quite simply, look like barbie dolls. they wear more makeup than jodie marsh, whom most aspire to be like- others simply wish to work as mothers. a chisel and a wallpaper stripper is often needed to remove this makeup, although it would be best to just not wear it, as the ominous orange glow is blinding to those who get too close. barbie’s chew gum constantly, opening their mouths as wide as a hippos so everyone can see their teeth marks in their “chud”.   cramlington high school is split in to several blocks- a block, b block, d block, p.e, sixth form, music and drama, social block, the discovery zone, a hall and b hall. b block, the dullest part of the school, is prone to graffiti in toilets and people running to hide in at lunch times, and succeeding for five minutes before being chucked out by the member of staff on duty.  a block is most common for barbie’s to go and apply another layer of make-up.  social is prone to chav’s and barbie’s sitting around gossiping about who shagged who, what rumours to start spreading,  who they think is a mess, who is a “propa fkin bitch man” and other mindless chatter.  cchs is often noticed for the hovering smog from cigarettes around the premises, and the echo of dj music, meaningless to anyone who hears it. however, these people are quickly shifted out on to vocational studies trips whenever ofsted come to rate the school, thus gaining it high marks for teaching in small classes.  the head teacher of cchs is one mr wyse, known only for sitting in his office eating doughnuts and getting little year nines who are on student reception to fetch his meals at lunch time. he rarely ventures out of his office, but when he does, it is either when it is quiet outside, or when he is surrounded by important- looking men. he is also famous for successfully being able to put a whole hall full of students to sleep during one of his all-important-speeches that are completely irrelevant to the students. he, obviously, is all fun, fun, fun.

"jaw","Jaws","a classic film released in 1975, about a great white shark that stalks a summer beach community. it stars roy scheider as chief of police martin brody, richard dreyfuss as icthylogist matt hooper and robert shaw as captain quint. it was directed by steven spielberg.  in the movie, after the brutal attack on a skinny-dipping woman by a shark and later on the same fate of a little boy, brody and hooper try to convince the mayor larry vaughan (played by murray hamilton) to close the beaches in the interest of people's lives. however, mayor vaughan continuously refuses to do so because he's interested in keeping the town's public image good and making money. after an attack on the beaches on the fourth of july, brody and hooper join captain quint, an ahab-like shark-hunter to venture out into sea to kill the shark.   it is adapted from a peter benchley novel of the same title. however, the film is often considered better the book, because peter benchley has admitted that he only needed the story because someone offered him money to put the idea on paper, because of his financial problems at the time. i personally think the novel is pretty decent. however, many critics claim it is unprofessionaly written and that it doesn't focus enough on the story of the shark and the community.   the film won many awards, and it considered one of the greatest films ever.  three sequels were made to jaws, jaws 2 in 1978, jaws 3 (or jaws 3-d, as it was released in 3-d) in 1983, and jaws: the revenge in 1987. jaws: the revenge and jaws 3-d are considered to take place in alternate scenarios, as they have been said to contradict each other. also, jaws: the revenge is frequently voted as one of the worst films ever made, although it does have michael caine and mario van peebles.   also, jaws took two years to make, and is definitely one of the hardest films ever made, or to make. the mechanical shark failed often, actors would get stressed out, but the film came out as the ultimate classic nonetheless."

"koc","Koc","in almost every chatroom, one individual is quickly and informally identified as the “slowest” member of the community. this is individual is commonly referred to as the “koc.” the origin of the term is unclear. it may be derived from a psychological term. it may be an acronym. in any event, its use has become more prevalent over the past few years.  many in the chatroom are tolerant and spend a good portion of the chat each day explaining relatively simple concepts to the koc. others are less tolerant of the amount of time required to provide “remedial chat” since it detracts from the flow of conversation, i.e. “dumbs down” the chat.   an interesting aspect of this situation is the koc will usually not recognize the mocking and insults of the less tolerant chatters. if recognized, the koc will dismiss criticism as a function something other than his/her own individual characteristics, e.g. people are exhibiting racism, sexism, and/or elitism toward him/her.  similarly, the situation is complicated because the koc is usually unaware of his/her shortcomings and pretends to be more intellectually skilled and/or educated than is actually the case. this is obvious to all in the chatroom except the koc. one implication is frequently the domination of the conversation by the koc. often, the quality of the conversation and attendance of the chatroom suffers as a result.  in spite or because of his/her limitations, the koc is often opinionated. the koc will often adopt bizarre position on issues such as defending or minimizing rape, pedophilia, and animal cruelty. on it’s face, this appears to be an attention getting mechanism but familiarity with a koc reveals, these positions are sincerely held and are more likely the result of substantial intellectual deficits and associated deficits in social skills and language. however, the unevenness of development across areas suggests an acute event, e.g. brain injury, rather than garden-variety mental retardation.  since these problems (disabilities) are readily apparent to the chat group, members are often sympathetic, even when the koc remarks, other members of the group are “boring.” this pity sometimes results in members defending the koc even when he/she adopts significantly maladjusted and ridiculous position such as “sex is gross.” however, some members can not help involuntarily spitting on the screen when encountering such odd notions expressed by an adult.  the author believes a koc should be gently counseled into joining more appropriate chatrooms. however, the author also recognizes, chatrooms are usually not designed to provide the therapy and remedial assistance that would benefit a koc. in addition, a more “intellectually appropriate” chatroom may needlessly expose young children to a possibly dangerous individual.  please use the “comment” feature provided if you have experiences with a koc.

don't take love foregiven. if you keep getting love from a person and never give anything back you will lose her/him one day, show some love back and not just keep taking, without giving.

doesn't matter if it's a person there isn't a girl or boy -friend, it could be a friend, your parrents.

be nice to the persons that do something for you show that you thankful/appreciate for the thing they do for you. like if your parrents give you something, show them that your thankful for they gave you something, give some love back when they do something for you, don't take their love foregiven - so you won't regret the day they are gone, that you didn't show them enough that you appreciate all the things they did for you. so it won't become lost hugs and kisses.

puns are a dark art, much like [necromancy]. raising the dead will get you killed. raising a pun with your killer sense of humor will get you killed, making it a grave [mistake], even if you were dead serious.

puns can be categorized into the following:

one liners

micro-liners: made in only a few words, these can only be wielded by true pun masters (think word-within-a-word)

epics:

this is the most evil form of pun magic. an epic is when someone finds a basic enough pun, then creates an incredibly detailed background for it, taking as much as hours to read, then ending it with the most basic one-liner or even micro-liner. the key to these is to find a pun that is the easiest to set up, then just drag it out as intricately as possible to create a story that feels like it will have an incredible ending, but ends with a three-word micro-liner.

everything else:

this ranges from creative plays on words or just idiots

warning: practice puns with a friend who does not know how to commit murder, otherwise you will be brutally disemboweled. until you can call yourself a true master, avoid using them in public.

"vhs","Vhs","a rather crude and low quality tape-based video recording format from the 70s, which remained popular 'till the 90s, mainly because it was the lowest common denominator (practically everybody back then had a vhs machine).

vhs can capture only a portion of the detail the tv signal offers (less than 50%), even in ""standard play"" mode. original vhs recorders could only record low quality mono sound, but later-day vhs recorders could also record hi-fi stereo. the biggest disadvantages of vhs were it's low quality blurry picture, and the fact the tapes lost even more detail when stored, played or copied. so, once you wrote something on vhs, it was guaranteed to become progressively worse in terms of quality over time.

a close cousin of vhs is s-vhs, an upgraded version which captures most of the detail the tv signal offers (close to 90%), but unfortunately s-vhs tapes lose detail over time too.

people like me who like to preserve their family videos and tv recordings for as long as possible hate even the mention of the name vhs (and s-vhs), as it brings back bleak memories from the 80s of their favorite videos rotting away without them being able to do something to save them (copying them resulted in loss of detail by itself and was only a temporary measure).

better recording alternatives include dv recorders, dvd recorders, dvrs and media center pcs.

believe it or not, there are people who still like vhs and mourn over it's loss, for reasons that contradict common logic."

"wee","Wee","wee |wē|

exclamation • used as a greeting: ""wee""

• used as a farewell: ""wee""

• used as an understanding: (instead of ""word"", or ""ok"") person1: ""meet me at persons at 10."", person2: ""wee""

• used as an agreement: (instead of ""yes"", or ""i agree"") person1: ""want to go canoe the parker river?"" person2: ""wee""

• may also be combined with other words: ""[oh wee]"" or ""o wee"", ""[wee-bub]""

• |wee| often pronounced with a falling intonation pattern and a prolonged final vowel

• can mean almost anything, varying by the tone in which it is used. however it is usually not negative, as byfielders (the native users of the word) are not negative people. the wee is not a word, yet a place of mind. (source: qm)

when ""wee"" is heard, it is custom to return said wee, with a follow-up reply, ""wee"".

origin mid 19th cent.: settlers from europe landed in the mid 17th cent. in what today is known as byfield, massachusetts. with settlers coming from various countries throughout europe, the people of byfield began creating their own language to; communicate, identify residence, and to be able to identify outsiders. ""wee"" being the first, and arguably the only word in the entire language. neighboring towns, such as newburyport (to the north), have attempted (unsuccessfully) to adopt a word with similar abilities; ""yeat"". but to no avail.

it has been suggested that the greeting phrase in james camrons motion picture: avatar (2009), ""i see you"" was derived from byfields use of the word ""wee"""
